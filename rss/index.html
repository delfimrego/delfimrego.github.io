Those markets have something in common:<strong> the risk of failure has a high impact and both corporations and their customers are averse to accept it.</strong></p><p>A company building a satellite that costs hundreds of millions will have a hard time explaining its customers that they value <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">individuals and interactions over processes and tools</a>. A simple design issue can turn those hundreds of millions into a expensive useless orbital brick in the sky.</p><p>A drug that kills people due to bypassing regulatory testing will have consequences on both the laboratory and the public organisation overseeing the process. The same for anyone building a airplane that kills hundreds due to bypassing safety in order to reduce cost.</p><p>Those industries are therefore more inclined to implement an high volume of processes and documentation and a highly detailed requirements, design, implementation and test specifications. In fact, their customers (and overseeing organisations like FAA, FDA, DOT, ...) will enforce it.</p><p>This naturally blocks rapid innovation and delays time to market of new products and solutions. At the expense of increasing safety. But it's worth it, right? Well, actually not anymore. Over time, the processes these companies are using are actually blocking them on a daily basis.</p><p>The risk averse culture reached a point where you start hearing jokes about it: "the safest plane in the world is the one we prevent from flying!", "no one was ever fired for deciding the satellite needs more testing and is not ready to launch".</p><p>Teams performing quality and safety assessment have a tendency to deny anything and approve nothing, demanding a lot of exhaustive documentation in the process.</p><p>Does highly focused process driven approach improves safety? Not anymore, mainly because of one single factor: experimentation. These processes are so costly that companies started to use modelling instead of actually testing and experimenting new hardware. They focus more on creating documental evidence than actually testing their assumptions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/pexels-spacex-23769.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Working on a conservative, traditional industry resisting to change?" srcset="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/pexels-spacex-23769.jpg 600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/pexels-spacex-23769.jpg 1000w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/pexels-spacex-23769.jpg 1600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/pexels-spacex-23769.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@spacex?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">SpaceX</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/space-rocket-orbit-galaxy-23769/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a></strong></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-case-of-boing-vs-spacex">The case of Boing vs SpaceX</h2><p>One recent example is the <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-2nd-software-glitch-potential-collision.html">Boing Starliner crew capsule Demo-1 test flight failure</a>. There were multiple issues with that test flight but there is common pattern: they never actually tested the aircraft integrated with its Atlas 5 launcher. They never tested the communication with ground systems. They never did end-to-end testing. The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-and-boeing-complete-orbital-flight-test-reviews">NASA investigation led to 61 corrective actions</a> for Boing to implement.</p><p>Now lets compare with SpaceX. Before it's Demo-1 flight, Crew Dragon testing uncovered that the parachutes safety margins were not acceptable. Additional testing also uncovered that existing models used by everyone did not simulate those failures. A new design was introduced, followed by extensive testing until enough data for the models were collected. Testing only stopped when everyone had a high confidence that parachutes would function as expected.</p><p>Then, after a very successful Demo-1 mission, SpaceX did additional static firing testing on the returning capsule, finding a catastrophic failure that would never happen in a mission (multiple ignitions of the launch abort system). If the test were to be performed by a brand new capsule, the issue would never be found.</p><p>SpaceX performs testing as a way to learn, to better understand the hardware they're designing. To question their our assumptions.</p><p>Traditional organisations in the same areas tend to test "as needed". Testing is performed to confirm a detailed specification. No more, no less. Specially when it involves hardware or end-to-end testing. Testing is rarely used to discover what isn't on the specification.</p><p>During the Boing Starliner investigation, NASA officials admitted that placed more scrutiny to SpaceX, because decades of working with Boing gave them a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/science/boeing-starliner-nasa.html?source=content_type:react%7Cfirst_level_url:news%7Csection:main_content%7Cbutton:body_link">good level of trust on their processes</a>. Because SpaceX followed a nontraditional approach to their development, NASA spent more time overseeing their activities.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Working on a conservative, traditional industry resisting to change?" srcset="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg 600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg 1000w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg 1600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Boing 737 MAX, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_737-8_MAX_N8704Q_rotated.jpg">source</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-case-of-boing-vs-airbus">The case of Boing vs Airbus</h2><p>The problems with Boing 737 MAX started when the company stopped listening to its customers. The market wanted longer range and better fuel efficiency. To respond to customer needs, Airbus developed the A320neo. Boing initially rejected doing the same, even when a long time loyal customer, American Airlines, insisted on it. After being ignored by Boing, AA went forward and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airbus-a320neo-beats-out-boeing-in-amrs-order-2011-07-20">ordered A320neos</a>, ending a 15-year monopoly.<br>Boing was forced to respond rapidly. The 737 MAX was the solution found but had to reach the market fast.<br>One of the 737 MAX upgrades were newer, larger engines but they did not fit below the wing so were moved farther forward. The engine placement effectively made the 737 MAX series a fundamentally different aircraft with different handling characteristics requiring new operational software and pilot training. The re-certification process Boeing sought to avoid for competitive reasons would have been lengthy and expensive. The solution was to add a single sensor and a software fix: MCAS.<br>Boing used a common strategy in the safety assessment world. To certify by Inheritance: instead of certifying a new vehicle you change one that's already certified and only certify the changes. The problem is that 737s design dates back to the late 1960s, already in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737">fourth generation</a>. The result was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/business/boeing-737-max-grounding-cost/index.html">346 deaths</a> and the most expensive corporate blunder ever.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512758017271-d7b84c2113f1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHN0YXJ0dXB8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Working on a conservative, traditional industry resisting to change?" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512758017271-d7b84c2113f1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHN0YXJ0dXB8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512758017271-d7b84c2113f1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHN0YXJ0dXB8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512758017271-d7b84c2113f1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHN0YXJ0dXB8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512758017271-d7b84c2113f1?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHN0YXJ0dXB8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Daria Nepriakhina</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="experiment-learn-and-adapt">Experiment, Learn and Adapt</h2><p>Both cases expose a common problem affecting traditional risk averse industries. The process avoids experimentation, it promotes stagnation.</p><p>Our knowledge only improves if we are willing to test our assumptions, if we are willing to fail. Experimentation is useless if only used to confirm what we know (what's on the specification). We need to test beyond our knowledge learn something new on every test (what isn't on the specification).</p><p>Systems (and businesses) are more complex than before. It's not enough to just consider a engineer's experience to design a solution. You need to gather data. It's not enough to consider the entrepreneur's vision of the market trends. You need to gather data.</p><p>By experimenting and gathering data, you learn new things. And you adapt your strategy accordingly.</p><h2 id="failure-is-an-option-does-it-mean-we-need-to-accept-plane-crashes">Failure is an option? Does it mean we need to accept plane crashes?</h2><p>Of course not! Failure must be an option during product development, in order to have fail-proof (or fail-resilient) products in the end.</p><p>For the Experiment-Learn-Adapt cycle to work, you need to remove the negative bias towards failure. If an experiment fails, you always learn something. Therefore, several failures must be considered and expected during development. This will result in safer products (and resilient ones).</p><p>After development and once the product is on the market, it's important to continue the learn process. But if you build the right mindset during development, you probably incorporated on your product some flexibility allowing you to incorporate improvements even after market deployment.</p><h2 id="where-to-start-the-change">Where to start the change?</h2><p>Start with your product/service vision. Question that vision. Talk with potential customers, make small experiments to test your vision, to test your assumptions. Gather the data and review it. Learn from it and adapt your vision accordingly.</p><p>Do the same for the product/service development. Start with your product/service solution. What is the biggest risk/assumption that you are making? Work on an experiment to check it. Learn from it and adapt accordingly.</p><p>What about teams and how they work? The same, do some team changes to verify your assumptions. Learn from it and adapt. Better yet, ask the teams to do it themselves!</p><p>What about the process and all the safety related activities? Question each one individually. What makes sense? What part is just bureaucracy and does not actually improve safety? Either remove them or find a way to automate the process in a way that the actual data provided is updated with the experiments you've made.</p><p>During this adapt-learn-adapt process people will start to identify problems with the organisation structure, or find people unwilling to change. Those changes will take longer but are inevitable if people are valued for their curiosity and courage. Be open to new ideas and other opinions. Ask for feedback and share mistakes and achievements.</p><p>Big traditional corporations, and their customers, will take longer to transform their ways. Some will suffer more than others. But the transformation it's inevitable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585064210818-8b7af20d03b4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoYW5nZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Working on a conservative, traditional industry resisting to change?" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585064210818-8b7af20d03b4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoYW5nZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585064210818-8b7af20d03b4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoYW5nZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585064210818-8b7af20d03b4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoYW5nZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585064210818-8b7af20d03b4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoYW5nZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2333 2333w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Markus Spiske</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 minute guide to motivate your squad for more focus and productivity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Motivation plays an important role on team performance.

In the past, motivation was driven mostly by external factors, such as payment, bonuses or promotions. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Extrinsic_motivation">extrinsic motivation</a>.<br>But extrinsic motivators only have positive influence on mechanical or repetitive activities, as research demonstrated since the early 1970s. <sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> In fact, extrinsic motivators can even lead to lower performance on tasks requiring creativity, cognitive skills or decision making.</p><blockquote>"Workers in a wide variety of jobs are paid based on performance, which is commonly seen as enhancing effort and productivity relative to non-contingent pay schemes. However, psychological research suggests that excessive rewards can, in some cases, result in a decline in performance..." <em>Dan Ariely et al.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></blockquote><p>However, extrinsic factors can have a negative effect on motivation so make sure your team's salaries are consistent with your industry and geographic area, in order to attract or retain employees.</p><p>Science shows that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_motivation">intrinsic factors</a> are the ones to lead to better performance and personal satisfaction. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steven-Reiss/e/B0045AQANW">Steven Reiss</a> listed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425183408/">the 16 Basic Desires</a> that motivate our actions and define our personalities. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jurgen-Appelo/e/B00460MCJM">Jurgen Appelo</a> reduced this to 10 intrinsic desires on his <a href="https://noop.nl/2013/02/champfrogs.html">CHAMPFROGS model</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/motivators.png" class="kg-image" alt="5 minute guide to motivate your squad for more focus and productivity" srcset="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/motivators.png 600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/motivators.png 1000w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/motivators.png 1260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>CHAMPFROGS model, Management 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>But after doing Jurgeb's <a href="https://management30.com/practice/moving-motivators/">Moving Motivators</a> game with multiple teams, I believe to be safe to focus on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-H-Pink/e/B001IXS3PC">Dan Pink</a>'s three most important factors: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>, the need to be in control.

A sense of purpose gives value and significance to our work. A team with a clear vision and clear goals will feel inspired and increase productivity.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/autonomy-mastery-purpose.png" class="kg-image" alt="5 minute guide to motivate your squad for more focus and productivity" srcset="https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/autonomy-mastery-purpose.png 600w, https://delfimrego.github.io/content/images/2020/12/autonomy-mastery-purpose.png 614w"></figure><h2 id="how-these-intrinsic-factors-affect-the-team-s-productivity">How these intrinsic factors affect the team's productivity?</h2><p>Autonomous teams will feel more responsible for their work and will actively react to anything that stands in the way. If a team has the autonomy to decide how to accomplish its tasks, then it will choose the right strategy to accomplish them, thus increasing productivity.</p><p>On the other hand, if the team is following blindly a top-down plan, the team will feel "it's not OUR plan, so not our responsibility if does not work". Anything that stands in the way will just be another confirmation bias and yet another complaint about the plan - thus decreasing productivity.</p><p>Mastery is directly related with the team's capabilities and challenges presented to them. If the challenge is too easy to accomplish they will become bored, and productivity will decrease - not because they are not able to do it, but because it does not stimulate the will to work. On the other hand, if the challenge is too hard, the team will become anxious and will give up, thus also reducing productivity.</p><p>The key is <em>improvement</em>. With effort and persistence, the challenge must be possible in a way that, once completed, the team learned and improved themselves. This will lead the team to a state of flow and engagement that will naturally improve productivity over time.</p><p>But mastery and autonomy will not matter if the team lacks a goal, or does not believe in it. Purpose is what drives passion and commitment. A team inspired by a vision, a team that knows what are the benefits of their work will be encouraged to work together towards that goal.
